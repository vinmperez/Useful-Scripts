%This is a list of Matlab Cobra Toolbox Commands%

initCobraToolbox	% Initiates the toolbox
model=readCbModel	% Allows you to open up an xml file
writeCbModel()	% Writes out the current model
cellstr(char.header)	% Converts a character to a cellstr
tdfread()	% Reads a csv file or text file
tblread()	% Reads a table
printRxnFormula(model_Obj_biomass, chowList)	%Prints reaction formula from a list (list being "Rxn Id","Rxn Id", et cetera
writeCbModel(model,'xlsx','mouseLiverWTmodel')	%Writes the model as an excel file
modelNew = changeObjective(model, 'GLCt1r', 0.5);	%changes the objective function
modelNew = changeObjective(model, 'GLCt1r', 0.5);	%finds exchange reactions
changeRxnBounds(model, rxnNameList, value, boundType)
changeCobraSolver(solverName, solverType, printLevel, ValidationLevel) ex. changeCobraSolver('gurobi')
[hiCarbonRxns, zeroCarbonRxns, nCarbon]=findCarbonRxns(model, nCarbonThr)	%nCarbonThr = defines the minimum number of carbons that a metabolite can have in the final list of reactions
combine2models() 	%combines 2 models
extractSubnetwork() 	%extracts all the rules of reactions based on the reaction identifier (i.e. HMR_0031)
