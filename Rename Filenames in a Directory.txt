%%%This is a line to replace all parts of a filename in a directory with a different string%%%

%%%In the windows power shell use this.
get-childitem *.mp3 | foreach { rename-item $_ $_.Name.Replace("Radiohead -", "") }

%get-childitem *.mp3
%This lists all files whose names end with .mp3.  They are then piped to the next command with the | operator.

%foreach { rename-item $_ $_.Name.Replace("Radiohead -", "") }
%This replaces all instances of Radiohead - with nothing, denoted by "", effectively wiping the word from all the files in the directory.

%You could also modify get-childitem *.mp3 to get-childitem â€“ that would rename all the files in the directory, not just files whose names end with .mp3.
